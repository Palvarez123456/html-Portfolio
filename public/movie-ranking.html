<h3>Dawn of the dead</h3>
<p>George A. Romeros tale of the dead coming back to life and attacking the living. The acting is believable and for the era this film was made in. It was perfect for a young kid to come across and just fall in love with his story. After everything starts to fall apart and the police are failing to stop the rising. A few people band together to survive in a mall. Not all humans are friendly in this world.</p>
<h3>Day Of The Dead</h3>
<p>The sequel to Dawn Of The Dead which released in 1985. The world has further progressed in George A. Romero's world of the living trying to survive in the land of the dead. Did you see what I just did there? EH, EH? If you didn't get it...Oh, well. Civilians and military alike are working together in a bunker to try and find a solution to the undead problem. Nothing in this world really works out for the survivors and I just fell in love with the day to day survival aspect along with the ideal that is inserted in this film. What is worse? The dead coming back to life to hunt the living or the living that attacks the living? In a world where walking dead and humans alike will bring harm to you. What do you really do?</p>
<h3>Labyrinth</h3>
<p>Labyrinth or as I like to call it The Labyrinth was filmed in 1986 and falls under the category of fantasy/musical. A 16 year old girl named sarah wishes away her crying baby brother resulting in goblins taking him away to a far away land where the goblin king resides. She has to navigate her way through an endless labyrinth to get to the center and take back her baby brother before time runs out. The star in this film Jennifer Connelly a.k.a. Sarah was my first crush and to be honest the trolls in this movie defenitely kept me up a few nights. The part where they remove their heads creeped me out as a kid.</p>
<h3>Once Upon A Time In America</h3>
<p>This film is epic. Shot in 1984 and has an all star cast if you're mid thirties or higher. The faces will be familiar. Hah! The original film was six hours long then shrunk down to 4 hours and ultimately down to 2hours 19 mins. Alot of controversy was around the length of the film and which version was better. With that background info aside I will copy and paste a rough sum from wikipedia. "Once Upon a Time in America (Italian: C'era una volta in America) is a 1984 epic crime film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone, and starring Robert De Niro and James Woods." It's a tale of three thugs that live a life of crime and how it all plays out. Love, greed, betrayal, it's all in here.</p>
