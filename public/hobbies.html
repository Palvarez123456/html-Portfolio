        <h2>What is Paul Alvarez into?</h2>

        <ul>
            <h3><li>Learning something new</li></h3>
            <p>Whether it is a fast five minute read or a project i set to learn. I like to learn something new each day no matter how insignificant it may be to some</p>
            <h3><li>Cooking</li></h3>
            <p>Your boy can get down in the kitchen or on the BBQ grill. I love slow cooking/smoking meats from fall of the bone but crisp/snap when you bite into it ribs(if you know, you know. If you don't, you better find out!) to prime rib. Salmon, Cod, Talapia, with blackened seasoning and homemade salsas. Chicken parmagiana or chicken enchiladas made from scratch to name a few specialties around my house. </p>
            <h3><li>Exercising/Weight Lifting</li></h3>
            <p>I used to exercise every other day 2 1/2 - 3 hours every other day for years and then covid hit. At his point in my life I was no longer aloud to goto a gym and my partner being immuno-compromised I just don't risk going to a gym anymore and workout from home now. I'm not as hardcore anymore but I still keep an eye on my fitness.</p>
            <h3><li>Spending time with my bestfriend/lover</li></h3>
            <p>I can honestly say my bestfriend is my first true love. She refuses to watch the low budget zombie movies I like to check out (always searching for good horror titles but I love zombies)and horror genre in general. Your bestfriend can be completely opposite of you and that is ok. Yin to my Yang. Spending time with her is my favorite most thing to do on this planet. Equal to seeing and spending time with my mother or family.</p>
            <h3><li>Spending time with family</li></h3>
            <p>Think most people share this hobby of mine. It is always awesome to spend time with family members and keep up to date on the day to day stuff your circle goes through. Life is a journey and if you don't have a family to share time with then create a circle of your own. The saying is "Blood is thicker than water." To that I shall add blood is thicker than water but not all family has to be blood. I have friends and in-laws/extended family that I love dearly and would do almost anything for!</p>
            <h3><li>Coding</li></h3>
            <p>I've always been into coding because I liked video games a lot in my younger years and enjoy creating stuff. I never took the time to learn but when I started that path it became a hobby and passion. This kind of falls into place with learning something new everyday. This subject is always changing and there is just so much vast amounts of information out there. I feel like I can spend the rest of my life coding and learning new languages, programs, code, etc.</p>
            <h3><li>Video games</li></h3>
            <p>I started my journey of video games as a kid like most others. The era I jumped in was Nintendo and Super Nintendo. From there Playstation all the way to Playstation 4. I also had a XBOX until I got the infamous red ring of death. Xbox one X to Xbox Series X. Nowadays, I have the XBOX Series X along with a Nintendo Switch. I don't hardcore game like I used too but I did spend some time geeking out in World of Warcraft(Classic WOW - Lich King played a max level Shadow Priest, Arms Warrior, Warlock.) Popped in every expansion up until the most recent Dragon something? I still have buddies that play it. Those were some good fun times back then! Not sure if my favorite game of all time would be Final Fantasy 6, Final Fantasy 7, Legend of Dragoon, or Xenogears?</p>
            <h3><li>Watching cool movies</li></h3>
            <p>Until I met my soulmate. I pretty much just watched anything horror genre but particularly zombie movies along with Anime. That habit was broken once she...Well, broke me in. Haha. Now I can say that I enjoy everything from George A. Romero's titles (I love them all. He will always be my favorite Film Director) to Romance titles like The Notebook! Yes, I said it. The Notebook is one of my favorite movies now! I'm man enough to admit it. While Iâ€™m at it. Brokeback Mountain was also a good generational film of its time. It spoke about a subject that was still taboo in its time. I tend to be picky what kind of anime I watch but Onimusha is a game I played as a kid on Playstation1 and the anime movie Netflix released was awesome! Beserk, Howls Moving Castle, Princess Monoke, High School of The Dead, Karas The Prophecy, Karas The Revelation(the fight scenes just really sucked me in. These last two titles is what I first watched.) I'll just stop here because I can keep going.</p>
